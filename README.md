# Bugs/Known Issues

# Resolved Issues

- When creating Procfile, I originally had typed 'web:python run.py' instead of 'web: python run.py'- this meant my Heroku app did not run and threw and Application Error, Cormac @ Code Institute spotted this

# Deployment

## Heroku

- Create Heroku app
- Connect Git remote
- Add requirements.txt(so Heroku knows what libraries we are using) and Procfile files(so Heroku knows we are running a Python app)

## GitHub 

As with my first milestone project, I had the same issue whereby, after deployment, I had the revise all of the image file paths and CSS links as these were not relative and did not work correctly when deployed.
